Quarterly and yearly growth (QoQ & YoY) by manufacturer

Category-wise performance (2W / 3W / 4W)

Automated investor insights & risk signals

ðŸ“‚ Data Assumptions

Category buckets mapped heuristically:

TWO WHEELER* â†’ 2W

THREE WHEELER* â†’ 3W

LMV/MMV/HMV/Light/Medium/Heavy â†’ 4W

Missing growth columns (qoq_pct, yoy_pct) are computed programmatically.

Null values are treated as 0 to avoid chart errors.
